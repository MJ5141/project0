## The project's aim

* Build a web application from scratch
* Use programming skills to map out the game logic
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS
* Work with array, objects, event handlers and callbacks
* To learn how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors

## Technologies

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* DOM

## Game development approach

* To keep things simple (KISS) and meet basic requirements
* Create and style basic layout in HTML & CSS
* Apply all the basic concepts gained till now
* Make the game working
* Advance styling
* DRY principles

## Game rules

* The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
* You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
